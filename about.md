# Funding
The development of PySCF has been and continues to be generously supported by a
number of funding agencies.  Most of the molecular quantum chemistry software
infrastructure was developed with support from the US National Science
Foundation, through grants CHE-1650436 and ACI-1657286. The periodic mean-field
infrastructure was developed with support from ACI-1657286. The excited-state
periodic coupled cluster methods were developed with support from the US
Department of Energy, Office of Science, through the grants DE-SC0010530 and
DE-SC0008624. Additional support for the extended-system methods has been
provided by the Simons Foundation through the Simons Collaboration on the Many
Electron Problem, a Simons Investigatorship in Theoretical Physics, the
Princeton Center for Theoretical Science, and startup funds from Princeton
University and the California Institute of Technology.
