# Installation with pip

The simplest way to install PySCF is via the Python Package Index (PyPI),
which provides a precompiled PySCF code (Python wheel) that works on most
Linux systems, macOS systems, and Ubuntu subsystems on Windows 10:
``` shell
$ pip install pyscf
```
If you already have pyscf installed, you can upgrade it to the newest
version:
``` shell
$ pip install --upgrade pyscf
```

## BLAS

PySCF requires a BLAS library, which is typically detected automatically. If a
BLAS library exists but wasn't detected or an undesired BLAS library was
detected, you can specify the BLAS library in one of two ways:
- use the `LDFLAGS` environment variable: 
  ``` shell
  $ LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/blas -lblas" pip install pyscf
  ```
- use the `PYSCF_INC_DIR` environment variable:
  ``` shell
  $ PYSCF_INC_DIR="/path/to/blas:/path/to/other/lib" pip install pyscf
  ```

#### Note
{:.alert-heading} 

Precompiled Python wheels sometimes don't work with certain version of Python
(3.4 and 3.5). If youâ€™re using macOS with python 3.4 or 3.5, pip may execute the
setup.py file in the source directory and terminate due to a path error for the
BLAS library. This can be fixed by specifying the path to the BLAS library
as described above.

## Libxc

The `pyscf.dft` module requires the exchange-correlation functional library
[Libxc](https://tddft.org/programs/libxc/), which is not yet available in the
PyPI repository.  To enable the `pyscf.dft` module, Libxc can be downloaded and
manually compiled using the `--enable-shared` flag.  The path to Libxc must be
provided in the `PYSCF_INC_DIR` environment variable before installing PySCF, e.g.
``` shell
$ PYSCF_INC_DIR="/path/to/libxc" pip install pyscf 
``` 

# Installation with conda

PySCF can be installed using the <a href="https://conda.io/en/latest/">conda</a> package manager
(available separately or as a part of the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">Anaconda </a>
Python distribution):
``` shell
$ conda install -c pyscf pyscf
```

# Docker image

PySCF is available as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) image.  For
browser-based use, you can start a container with a Jupyter notebook server
listening for HTTP connections on port 8888,
``` shell
$ docker run -it -p 8888:8888 pyscf/pyscf-1.7.1
```
and then visit `https://localhost:8888` with your browser in order to use PySCF
in a notebook.

Alternatively, you can use Docker to enable PySCF in an
[IPython](https://ipython.org/) shell:
``` shell
$ docker run -it pyscf/pyscf-1.7.1 start.sh ipython
``` 

# Manual installation from source

To manually install PySCF from source available in the [GitHub
repo](https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf), see the detailed instructions available
[here](http://pyscf.github.io/pyscf/install.html#manual-installation-from-github-repo).
